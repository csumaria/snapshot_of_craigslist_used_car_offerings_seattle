# Welcome to Project Luther: Web Scraping and Regression Analysis of Craigslist Data

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

In this project, I have scraped data from over 4,500 web-pages of Craigslist-Seattle. The scraped data was analyzed for insights into the used car market. After cleaning the data, it was subjected to OLS Linear Regression with, and without, Regularization (Ridge, Lasso and Elastic regression models) along with 'Polynomial Features' and 'Standard Scalar'. Higher order terms were tested only for quantiative variables, whereas dummy variables were created for categorical variables.

The Jupyter Notebook files in this folder can be followed in the following order:

* Web_Scraping_Craigslist.ipynb - Results saved as two .pkl files
* Data Cleaning
* Regularization_over_entire_dataset.ipynb
* Model_for_Subarban_1500.ipynb

Note that some of the results from this analysis can be found in the 'Images' folder.
